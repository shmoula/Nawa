# NAWA - Nxt Assets Watcher for Android

A competition entry for [Nxt Hacks 2015 Hackathon](jnxt.org/nxthacks) by shmoula, NXT-EZHL-B8FR-PZHS-DZZBR.


NAWA is a simple Android application with widget, for which you can pick nxt assets, which you want to watch.

Not much time for realization, so I'm going to use Active Android and other dirty stuff, since domain model will be simple, sorry 'bout that O:).
